lz-string-unsafe
=========
LZ-based (unsafe) compression algorithm for JavaScript

## Forked version

This fork is copied directly from https://github.com/JobLeonard/lz-string/tree/array-lookup branch.

We slapped a `-beta` on the last version and pushed it to npm.

Why? Because we needed to include this library in our Stylus extension and every library we use needs to have a proper source location with a release.

## Install via [npm](https://npmjs.org/)

```shell
$ npm install -g lz-string-unsafe
$ lz-string-unsafe input.js > output.txt
```
